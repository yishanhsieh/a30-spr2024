# Homework 03
# You need to define the AVL ADT, 
# then work out pseudocode for find, insert, delete.
# build AVL Tree here: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html

#start with an empty BST and then
#insert 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6 (showing what happens)
#then delete 2 (and explain each step)


# AVL (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-avl-tree/)
## self-balacing Binary Search Tree 
## an algorithm for the organization of information
## The difference between heights of left and right subtrees for any node cannot be more than one.
## Advantage: faster search, strict, binary tree only, items can be traversed in sorted order
## Disadvantage: less complex 

# ADT - abstract data type
## Heap(å †) --> min-heap & max-heap

# Red Black Tree (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-red-black-tree/)
## node, root, leaf are black, adn red property can't have red children
## ensure that the longest path from the root to any leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest path.

# Splay trees (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-splay-tree-data-structure/)
## The basic idea behind splay trees is to bring the most recently 
# accessed or inserted element to the root of the tree by performing 
# a sequence of tree rotations, called splaying. Splaying is a 
# process of restructuring the tree by making the most recently 
# accessed or inserted element the new root and gradually 
# moving the remaining nodes closer to the root.
