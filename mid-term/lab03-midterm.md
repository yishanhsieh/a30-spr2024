# Midterm exam

# 1. Start from an empty AVL tree and show what happens (draw on paper how the tree evolves)

# when you insert the following numbers: 5, 6, 7, 4, 3, 9, 8, 1, 2, 0 (in that order).

# 2. Starting from an empty Heap ADT show what happens (draw on paper how the tree evolves)

# when you insert the following numbers: 5, 6, 7, 4, 3, 9, 8, 1, 2, 0 (in that order).

# 3. Write a program that calculates all permutations of a given string.

# For example the following tests should pass without any error:

```
assert sorted(perm("hat")) \
       == sorted(['hat', 'aht', 'ath', 'hta', 'tha', 'tah']), \
       "First assert fails."
assert len(perm("race")) == \
       fact(len("race")), "Second assert fails."
assert len(perm("whatever")) == 40320, "Third assert failed."
print ("All assertions passed without a problem")
```

# Write perm and fact where fact calculates the factorial.

# 4. There are two parts to this problem. Start from the BstNode class provided (available for your

# perusal, if needed, on the next page). First describe what gets printed by the following code (shown

# below, on the left):
