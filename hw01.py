# bianry search tree (BST)
## a tree each of whose nodes may have no more than 2 children
## BST is a fundamental data structure, but the performance may suffer
## if the tree is unbalanced. There are types of balanced binary search tree 
## that use a set of rules to maintain balance.


#start with an empty BST and then
#insert 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6 (showing what happens)
#then delete 2 (and explain each step)
